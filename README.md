My webpage is an exercise in building a website. It is based on The Contemporary Austin's website.
The Contemporary Austin is the contemporary art museum of Autin, TX.
I will be building the website with HTML and CSS in Brackets. 
I chose The Contemporary Austin because I like how their website looks and I like that they are an art organization.
