#BUILD A WEBSITE PROJECT

###WHAT IS THE WEBPAGE ABOUT?

My webpage is an exercise in building a website. It is based on The Contemporary Austin's website.

The Contemporary Austin is the contemporary art museum of Autin, TX.

###REASON FOR CHOSING THE CONTEMPORARY AUSTIN

I chose The Contemporary Austin because I like how their website looks and I like that they are an art organization.

###TECHNOLOGY USED

I will be building the website with HTML and CSS.
