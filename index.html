            <p>Strange Pilgrims is the museum’s first large-scale, multi-site group exhibition for Fall 2015. Featuring fourteen international, cross-generational artists across three sites (the Jones Center, Laguna Gloria, and the Visual Arts Center in the Department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin), Strange Pilgrims is an open-ended, experiential journey through time, space, imagination, perception, and the senses.
